### Project Description

2020 were planned months ahead in my case, with many projects in head. But that Coronavirus happened and here I am, making new career plans in Ironhack Amsterdam and turning this difficult time into a brand new opportunity.  
So when we had to choose a subject for this second module project, it sounded like an evidence to me to talk about the global crisis going on.

But more than this, I want to see if there is a significant and efficient pattern in the different political responses given by each country around the world to limit the Covid-19 crisis.

### Dataset
The 2 sources I used come from :
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/master/data/OxCGRT_latest.csv Coronavirus Government Tracker updated by Oxford University.
 * https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data Our World in Data source that collects demographic informations.

### Workflow

My goal here was to rank the countries based on data, from the better response to the least. Then I wanted to see if there is any correlation between the available variables and indexes to classify the governmental measures.

I then tried to debunk some facts based on statistical tests.

See Jupyter Notebooks and Presentation for the results found.
